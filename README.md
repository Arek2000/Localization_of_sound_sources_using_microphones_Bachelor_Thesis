# Localization_of_sound_sources_using_microphones_Bachelor_Thesis
Objective
The purpose of this work is to build a device capable of detecting the direction of the highest amplitude sound. As part of the project, I will design a measurement system that will continuously monitor audio signals from the environment. This system will be able to transmit measurement data to a computer in real time.

On the computer side, an algorithm will be implemented that will calculate the direction of the sound based on audio signals from microphones. The system will be capable of displaying the results of calculations in real time in a graphical form.

This device has potential applications in numerous fields, such as recording studios, surveillance, wildlife studies, and any other area where identifying the direction of a sound source could be beneficial.
